Example config.json:

```
    "accessories": [
		{
			"accessory": "SoundTouch",
			"name": "Bathroom Speakers",
			"room": "Bathroom"
		}
	],
```

The 'accessory' should be set to 'SoundTouch' and the name is the name you want to use to control the SoundTouch.
The 'room' should match exactly with the name of the SoundTouch device.
